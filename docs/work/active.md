# Active work

## Current objective

The exact `e87c3237db0e256fb4af225c93ab6e4fd4660a67` release is now the serving single-host network. Continue with the smallest missing player slice: register real Velocity `/lkjmc` status/completion/server-transfer behavior, then prove it with a real client. Do not broaden the menu or dormant domains first.

## Repository state

- Recovery base: `339adb7bb60b6cce5229f98866f869363e90b78b`.
- Product and deployed release commit: `e87c3237db0e256fb4af225c93ab6e4fd4660a67`.
- Bootstrap foundation: `d3bcb67e927e0cca4b146185f54926595a53d343`.
- Branch before this ledger update: `main`, tracking `origin/main`, 16 commits ahead.
- Worktree was clean at `e87c323`; deployment evidence is ignored under `tmp/agent/deploy-20260814T041811Z/` via `tmp/agent/deploy-latest`.
- Exact private release: `~/lkjmc-private-releases/e87c3237db0e256fb4af225c93ab6e4fd4660a67/`.
- Release bundle SHA-256: `bb5bdc00d047ce1e2448f33a3612d939eb31b6b086d0d08bbe0b8aa9ddbfffe8`.

## Confirmed facts

### Implemented and tested

- `bootstrap.apply` is the only admitted external-effect command. It is authorized only for a kernel-verified local Unix peer and has a 20-minute decoded-command budget; request body ingestion, decode, and all ordinary commands retain the 8-second admission deadline.
- Bootstrap deterministically owns Velocity, hub, and survival, exact configured server-asset path/digest/project binding, Stop-before-Render-before-Start fencing, readiness waits, no-op reapply, partial-failure repair, and process adoption/recovery.
- Absent runtimes are distinct from owned runtimes. Persisted identities are removed only when the exact identity no longer matches and the recorded process group is absent; live/reused groups remain fenced.
- Backend `server-ip` is rendered from intent and checked as one canonical effective Java-properties assignment. Velocity bind is checked at the top-level TOML key. Closed-listener `TIME_WAIT` is not mistaken for an unowned listener.
- Database-backed bootstrap coverage passes all nine recovery/apply tests. Focused runtime, transport, property-parser, and unowned-listener regressions pass. Workspace Clippy and `./scripts/verify-fast.sh` pass.
- The exact release contains six fresh artifacts. Manifest verification, deployed hash verification, CLI identity, JVM identity, server-jar hashes, and installed plugin-jar comparisons all passed.

### Deployed and observed

- Serving container: `lkjmc-next`, Ubuntu Noble image fingerprint `343e93956ae55eca4ce8846d45d61657a3062de131861ab6ac31bddfe21e4cec`, IP `10.161.59.8`, 6 CPUs, 16 GiB memory limit, 128 GiB ZFS root, `security.nesting=false`, unprivileged idmap.
- Runtime packages: PostgreSQL 16 and OpenJDK 21. The fresh database has 50 migrations (versions 1 through 51, with removed version 15 absent).
- systemd starts the exact release and runs local bootstrap reapply through `ExecStartPost`. `KillMode=mixed` permits daemon-owned graceful Java shutdown. A bounded pre-apply plan retry tolerates only transient stale/unowned observations; other blocked plans fail startup.
- Clean first installation and first start succeeded without an intermediate repair: systemd active, `NRestarts=0`, one daemon, Velocity, hub, and survival.
- Velocity listens on `0.0.0.0:25591`; hub and survival listen only on loopback ports `25566` and `25567`; daemon HTTP `8765` and PostgreSQL `5432` are loopback-only.
- Real Minecraft status pings observed Velocity `3.4.0-SNAPSHOT`/protocol 774 and Folia `1.21.11-14` for both backends. Host access to backend, daemon HTTP, and PostgreSQL ports fails.
- No-op apply preserves all three Java PIDs.
- A direct `systemctl restart lkjmc-daemon` replaced all three PIDs, returned success, and ended with a no-op plan and `NRestarts=0`.
- A full Incus container restart changed boot ID, restored the daemon and three Java children, returned a no-op plan, and left `NRestarts=0`.
- Public cutover moved only TCP `25591` to `lkjmc-next`. Legacy daemon TCP `18765` and unused Bedrock UDP `25592` devices were removed, not moved.
- Historical `lkjmc`, intermediate `lkjmc-candidate`, and preserved `lkjmc-next-legacy-20260814` are stopped. Only `lkjmc-next` is running and only it owns a proxy device.
- Host-LAN Java ping still succeeds after stopping both prior serving candidates. External `api.mcstatus.io` reports `lkjsxc.com:25591` online with MOTD `lkjmc network`, zero players, and Velocity `1.7.2-1.21.11` compatibility text.
- Current CLI status truthfully reports process health but backend `ready:null`, `joinable:false`, and `heartbeat-missing`; plugin heartbeat/registration is not implemented.

## Preservation, backup, and rollback

- Original verified backup remains at `home-incus:~/backups/lkjmc/pre-recovery-20260813T132523Z/`; manifest SHA-256 `768a121d4138aa7ecd212ab3d7d53a359a12ece2dd30270a8b44e913d384c282`.
- Historical snapshots include `pre-recovery-20260813T132126Z`, `pre-latest-rebuild-20260814T042229Z`, and the fresh pre-cutover snapshot named in `tmp/agent/deploy-latest/historical-pre-cutover-snapshot-name.txt`.
- The old stopped `lkjmc-next` was renamed to `lkjmc-next-legacy-20260814`; its two original snapshots remain intact. Its current NIC override was removed only to release static IP `.8`; snapshots retain the old configuration.
- Final snapshots are named in `lkjmc-next-pre-container-restart-snapshot-name.txt`, `lkjmc-next-validated-snapshot-name.txt`, and `lkjmc-next-post-cutover-snapshot-name.txt`.
- Fresh serving backup: `home-incus:~/backups/lkjmc/e87-cutover-20260814T063433Z/private-backup-20260814T063433Z/`, 433,153,045 bytes before the candidate-local copy was removed. All five checksum targets passed.
- The PostgreSQL custom dump restored into a new disposable database and returned `50` migrations, `3` instances, and `2` jar assets. The filesystem archive extracted into a disposable root; both worlds, private config, and exact server assets were verified before deletion.
- Fast traffic rollback: remove `proxy-25591-tcp` from `lkjmc-next`, add the recorded identical TCP proxy device to stopped historical `lkjmc`, start historical `lkjmc`, and protocol-ping the host path. Do not restore daemon HTTP or Bedrock exposure unless explicitly approved.

## Decisions

- Historical world and database state may be discarded; backups and snapshots are the rollback boundary.
- Incus remains authoritative. No Docker socket, Incus socket, host mount, bridge bypass, privileged mode, or nested container support was added.
- Keep only the Velocity TCP proxy public. PostgreSQL, daemon HTTP, and backends remain private.
- Existing observed `eula=true` was reused; no acceptance was fabricated.
- Exact source and artifact identity take precedence over installation convenience. Deployment consumed only a clean commit release and verified immutable server jars.
- systemd owns restart reapply because daemon shutdown intentionally stops Java children and daemon startup alone does not reconcile them.
- The broad project is not player-accepted merely because the three-process network is serving.

## Acceptance completed

- Clean install into an unprivileged LXC system container: complete.
- Fresh PostgreSQL migration: complete.
- Exact Velocity plus two exact Folia processes ready: complete.
- Local, host-LAN, and external proxy status ping: complete.
- Backends/daemon/database private-boundary checks: complete.
- Initial apply and PID-preserving no-op reapply: complete.
- systemd restart recovery and full container restart recovery: complete.
- Private backup, checksum verification, PostgreSQL restore, and filesystem extraction drill: complete.
- Public TCP cutover with old deployment stopped and rollback retained: complete.

## Current failures and blockers

- Velocity still registers no real `/lkjmc` command. Completion, `/lkjmc status`, successful transfer, and truthful failed-transfer feedback have not been observed.
- No authorized real online-mode player/client login has run. The deployment is serving and externally pingable, but not player-accepted.
- Paper/Folia plugin startup is observed, but it emits degraded diagnostics and no daemon heartbeat; status therefore remains `ready:null`/non-joinable.
- The small menu has not been reduced to and proven against real actions.
- The shipped installer is not the deployment path used here; it still builds ambient checkout bytes and does not represent this immutable three-instance installation.
- Incus global container drop-ins override some systemd hardening such as `NoNewPrivileges`; the service remains an unprivileged `lkjmc` user inside an unprivileged container, with strict filesystem write paths and no public control API.
- Git push/release publication authentication remains unchecked.

```

The direct local public-DNS ping times out because this workspace cannot hairpin through the router; the host-LAN protocol ping and an independent external Minecraft status provider both pass.

## Next executable step

Read `platforms/jvm/velocity/src/main/java/com/lkjmc/velocity/LkjmcVelocityPlugin.java`, its focused tests, and the current typed status/transfer protocol. Implement only `/lkjmc`, `/lkjmc status`, and `/lkjmc server <hub|survival>` with Brigadier/platform completion, asynchronous daemon calls, scheduler-safe feedback, and one real transfer. Then build an exact release and deploy it through the already verified `lkjmc-next` update/restart path.
