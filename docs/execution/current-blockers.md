# Current blockers

## Purpose

This document lists the next executable blockers in priority order.

## Completed foundation

- [x] Repository, build, core model, config, store, daemon API, and CLI.
- [x] Local process runtime, jar registry, installer, and Java common module.
- [x] Velocity plugin, Paper/Folia plugin foundation, GUI framework, and
  player profile sync.
- [x] SMP and proxy utility imports, moderation, mail, kits, votes, daily
  rewards, announcements, points leaderboard, and live smoke scaffolding.
- [x] Documentation truth refresh and contract drift checks for commands,
  permissions, and locale catalogs.
- [x] Real daemon status and doctor checks.
- [x] Typed Java daemon transport and adapter JSON helpers.
- [x] PostgreSQL-backed chunk claims with Paper/Folia command and protection.
- [x] Opt-in daemon/CLI claim smoke coverage.
- [x] Opt-in live Paper claim integration smoke coverage.

## Active blockers

No tracked foundation blocker is open.

## Next executable step

Add a protocol-capable live player harness for executing `/claim` and block
interactions when that dependency is available; keep default verification
network-independent.
