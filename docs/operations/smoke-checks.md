# Smoke checks

## Purpose

This document defines optional smoke checks that exercise slow or external
runtime behavior.

## Opt-in checks

- `LKJMC_INSTALLER_SMOKE=1 ./scripts/check-installer.sh` runs a clean Ubuntu
  installer smoke.
- `LKJMC_JAR_LIVE_SMOKE=1 ./scripts/check-jar-registry.sh` downloads a live
  PaperMC server jar when PostgreSQL is configured.
- `LKJMC_MINECRAFT_SMOKE=1 ./scripts/check-minecraft-smoke.sh` downloads and
  starts standalone Paper and Velocity jars with built plugin jars.
- Adding `LKJMC_MINECRAFT_PLAYER_SMOKE=1` and a PostgreSQL test URL drives
  accepted and banned offline-mode Velocity login checks.

## Rule

Skipped live checks are reported as skipped and must never be described as
passed.
